# Python Crash Course Exercises

This file shows the solutions I have created for the exercises from the Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition book by Eric Matthes. All solutions were created within VSCode. 

Each solution is located within the folder for the respective chapter the exercise is from.

Starting in chapter 12, the chapters shift into projects. 

This file will be built upon as I continue to work through the book.
