# Exercise 8-17; Page 155; Styling Functions

# Choose any three programs you wrote for this chapter, and make sure they follow the styling guidelines describes in this section.

#   Styling Functions
# A few things need to be kept in mid when styling functions.
# Functions should have descriptive names and use lowercase letters and underscores.
# Module names should follow the same convention.

# Every function should have a comment that explains concisely what the function does.
# This comment should come right after the defintiion and in a docstring format.

# If you specify a default value for a parameter, no spaces sohuld be used on either side of the equal sign:
#   def function_name(parameter_0, parameter_1='default value')

# The same convention should be used for keyword arguments.
#   function_name(value_0, parameter_1='value')

# PEP 8 standard recommends that you limit lines of code to 79 characters so every line is visible in a reasonably sized editor window.

# If a set of parameters causes a function's definition to be longer than 79 characters, press enter after opening paranthesis on the definition line.
#   On the next line, press TAB twice to separate the list of arguments from the body of the function.

# Separate multiple functions by 2 lines.

# All import statements should be written at the beginning of a file.
# The only exception is if you use comments at the beginning of your file to describe the overall program.
