# Python Crash Course Exercises

This repo shows the solutions I have created for the exercises from the Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition book by Eric Matthes. All solutions were created within VSCode. 

Each solution is located within the folder for the respective chapter the exercise is from.

Starting in chapter 12, the chapters shift into projects. 

The overview.md file is work in progress of a full outline of all exercises.

Despite having this collection available in a repository, it is likely some of later exercises are recreated in their own Repo. If this proves to be the case, I will keep this collection updated and list related repositories within this README.
